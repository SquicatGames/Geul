Key Idea: Items are glued to the floor, and gravity acts backwards (which is a clich√©) on everything except the player. Name: G E U L which means GLUE with reverse gravity, also seagull in Dutch.
2d platformer with objects flying into space
Player tasks: everyday tasks like "go to the store"
Complications:
 - target objects for completing the task may disappear
 - the interval between the beginning of the unsticking of the object and the escape into space is reduced as it passes
 - platformer has map rotation zones - lanes, a large number of which complicates orientation in a virtual city
